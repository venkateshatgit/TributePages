            <h3>Here's a time line of Srila Prabhupada's life:</h3>

            <p>
                His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (1896-1977) is widely regarded as the 
                foremost Vedic scholar, translator, and teacher of the modern era. He is especially respected as the world's 
                most prominent contemporary authority on bhakti-yoga, devotional service to the Supreme Person, Krishna, as taught 
                by the ancient Vedic writings of India. He is also the founder-acharya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.
            </p>

            <p>
                Srila Prabhupada, as he's known to his followers, 
                translated and commented on over eighty volumes of the Vedas' most important sacred bhakti texts, 
                including the Bhagavad-gita—a concise handbook for understanding the purpose and goal of human life—and the multi-volume 
                Srimad-Bhagavatam—an epic biography of Krishna, 
                Krishna's avatars, and His many devotees throughout the history of the universe.
            </p>

            <p>
                After forty years of struggling within India to carry out his guru's order, 
                while maintaining family and business responsibilities, Srila Prabhupada boarded a steamship bound from Calcutta to New York City in 1965.
                At age sixty-nine, with forty rupees and a trunk of his Bhagavatam commentaries - the first ever in English - his aim was to introduce 
                "India's message of peace and goodwill" to the western world. During the last twelve years of his life, 
                Srila Prabhupada would inspire thousands of Westerners and Indians to devote their lives to Krishna consciousness, 
                launching one of the fastest-growing spiritual movements in the history of the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the help of his students, he founded the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).
                 ISKCON is popularly known as the "Hare Krishna" movement, due to its members' widespread practice of chanting the Hare Krishna mantra in public.
                  Srila Prabhupada intended ISKCON to facilitate the association and education of bhakti-yoga practitioners,
                 and his followers continue to spread that mission.
            </p>

                I have made the Bhagwad-Gita as the main source of my inspiration and guide for the purpose of scientific investigations and formation of my theories"<br><br>
